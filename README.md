# Coin Experiment

#### You are given a bag of 100 coins, with 99 fair ones flipping heads and tails with 0.50 probability each, and one unfair coin which flips heads with 1.0 probability. You pick a coin randomly and flip it 10 times, getting heads every single time. What is the probability that you picked the unfair coin?

##### The question can be answered quite easily using Bayes' Theorem from probability theory.
##### Answer is 91.18%.
